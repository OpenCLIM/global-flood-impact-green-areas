  summary: >
    This model takes building polygons supplied by the user, clips the data to the domain and ensures the data is in the correct projection.

  description: >
    The CityCAT model relies on building footprint data. Open source data can be obtained from Open Street Map (https://www.openstreetmap.org/),
    Open Buildings (https://sites.research.google/open-buildings/) etc. This model accepts building data in .gpkg format, clips the data to the
    selected area, and ensures all data is in the same projection. If the file sizes are too large, multiple .gpkgs can be added directly, or zipped.
