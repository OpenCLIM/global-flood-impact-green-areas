  description: >
    The CityCAT model can use greenspace polygons to determine permeability. This model accepts greenspace data in .gpkg format, clips the data to the
    selected area, and ensures all data is in the same projection. If the file sizes are too large, multiple .gpkgs can be added directly, or zipped.
