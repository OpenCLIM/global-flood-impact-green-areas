  summary: >
    This model takes greenspace polygons supplied by the user, clips the data to the domain and ensures the data is in the correct projection.

  description: >
    The CityCAT model can use greenspace polygons to determine permeability. This model accepts greenspace data in .gpkg format, clips the data to the
    selected area, and ensures all data is in the same projection. If the file sizes are too large, multiple .gpkgs can be added directly, or zipped.

    parameters:
      - name: PERMEABLE_AREAS

        type: string
        description:
          If `PERMEABLE_AREAS` is set to "polygons", polygons from the `green_areas` dataslot are used to define areas which are permeable.
          Otherwise, all cells are treated as being "permeable" or "impermeable", depending on the selection.
